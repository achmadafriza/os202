# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File Systems in a Nutshell](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/file-system)
    File systems are a way of Operating Systems to handle, well, our files (duh.). Imagine public libraries filled with wonderful and exciting knowledge. How would the librarian find our badly needed books for our very academic research? Every book would be indexed and categorized based on their type, genre, date of publishing, etc. Our files are the wonderful knowledge that our computers accumulated overtime, and its algorithms are the librarians painstakingly serving our needs of files.

2. [File System in Windows](https://www.ufsexplorer.com/articles/file-systems-basics.php#windows)
    File System in Windows date back on MS-DOS days. It uses several formats very familiar to us which have no idea what their meaning are (e.g. FAT and NTFS). Each of these formats have a similar way of handling files. Basically, Windows would index every file based on their size, allocation, name, etc. For example, FAT format would handle the index with a linked list of blocks. While NTFS format would have a Master table of indexes.
    Except, Windows still correlates it's files and software with the OS Registry and binary code. This makes file manipulation and system cleaning a really hard task to do.

3. [File System in Unix](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File_system#/Unix_and_Unix-like_operating_systems)
    The file system in Unix is a unique one. While in Windows, software still correlates with Registry and etc. Linux doesn't operate that way. Instead, it treats *every* software, binary code, registry, etc. as a file. This, in turn, makes Linux a very flexible and lightweight Operating System. Because, you can really delete every un-needed software and files.

4. [Disk Partitioning](https://www.howtogeek.com/184659/beginner-geek-hard-disk-partitions-explained/)
    Disk Partitioning is a way to divide a disk into several and independent spaces. These partitions can have different formats of file system. Well, it can have different Operating Systems as well. This can be useful if you have a need of different Operating Systems (I'm talking to you Windows) because of it's limitations; need of Development, Test, and Production environment; or maybe just for backup. It's keyword would be Independent, as each partition would be mutually exclusive to each other (Well, maybe not if the disk failed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

5. [What is RAID?](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid)
    While Disk Partitioning would be to split a storage into several unrelated spaces, RAID is a way to combine several storages together. RAID is one of the data storage virtualization technologies. It provides reliability, performance, and capacity to the system. It have several configurations, mainly RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. Each of these configurations will have different purpose and benefit to the system.

6. [Linux, Windows, and MinGW](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MinGW)
    Windows are a pain for Programmers. Why? Personally, because it's terminal is hideous, it's file system is a mess to use at terminals, and Linux is free and used by most of the systems in the world. However, I still need Windows for gaming (My bad...). I need a way to use these lovely Linux terminal commands (e.g. Package Management, SSH, File Syncing, etc.) while still using Windows. Well, MinGW is the solution!
    What is MinGW you ask? Imagine Linux and Windows having a baby. MinGW provides Unix-like capabilities while running completely native on Windows. There is a counterpart to MinGW, which is [Cygwin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cygwin) that provides POSIX emulation layer on top of Windows to run Unix programs.

7. [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
    MSYS2 is my go to for terminal uses in Windows. As I said before, it provides Unix-like capabilities natively in Windows. In my experience, it is relatively easy to setup and use. Eventhough in my case it is hard, as my installations are really cluttered (I should really reset my OS... Should I???). Here, I can even use make, rsync, wget, and soo much more. Even the terminal support ANSI colors. How cool is that, right?

8. [FUSE](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Filesystem_in_Userspace)
    Fuse stands for Filesystem in Userspace. It’s a software interface in Unix and Unix-like OS’s that allows non-privileged users to create their own file systems without editing the kernel code. This is done by running the file system code in the user space while FUSE acts as a bridge to the actual kernel.

9. [File Access Mechanisms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-access-methods-in-operating-system/)
   - Contiguous Allocation
      - Each file occupies a contiguous address space on disk.  
      - Assigned disk address is in linear order.  
      - Easy to implement.  
      - External fragmentation is a major issue with this type of allocation technique. 

   - Linked Allocation
      - Each file carries a list of links to disk blocks.  
      - Directory contains link / pointer to first block of a file.  
      - No external fragmentation.  
      - Effectively used in sequential access file.  
      - Inefficient in case of direct access file.

   - Indexed Allocation
      - Provides solutions to problems of contiguous and linked allocation.  
      - A index block is created having all pointers to files.  
      - Each file has its own index block which stores the addresses of disk space occupied by the file.  
      - Directory contains the addresses of index blocks of files  

10. [Virtual File Systems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Virtual_file_system)
    The Virtual File System (also known as the Virtual Filesystem Switch) is the software layer in the kernel that provides the filesystem interface to userspace programs. It also provides an abstraction within the kernel which allows different filesystem implementations to coexist.
