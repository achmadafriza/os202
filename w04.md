# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Memory Address in General](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memory_address)
    In computing, a memory address is a reference to a specific memory location used at various levels by software and hardware. Memory addresses are fixed-length sequences of digits conventionally displayed and manipulated as unsigned integers. Such numerical semantic bases itself upon features of CPU (such as the instruction pointer and incremental address registers), as well upon use of the memory like an array endorsed by various programming languages.
2. [What is a Logical Address?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-logical-address-in-os)
    Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a programâ€™s perspective. The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address.
3. [What is a Physical Address?](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Physical_address)
    Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space.
4. [Differences between Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)
    There are 5 notable differences between Logical and Physical Address:
     1. The basic difference between Logical and physical address is that Logical address is generated by CPU in perspective of a program whereas the physical address is a location that exists in the memory unit.
     2. Logical Address Space is the set of all logical addresses generated by CPU for a program whereas the set of all physical address mapped to corresponding logical addresses is called Physical Address Space.
     3. The logical address does not exist physically in the memory whereas physical address is a location in the memory that can be accessed physically.
     4. Identical logical addresses are generated by Compile-time and Load time address binding methods whereas they differs from each other in run-time address binding method. Please refer this for details.
     5. The logical address is generated by the CPU while the program is running whereas the physical address is computed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU).
5. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html)
    Memory allocation is primarily a computer hardware operation but is managed through operating system and software applications. Memory allocation process is quite similar in physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.
    Memory allocation has two core types:
    1. Static Memory Allocation: The program is allocated memory at compile time.
    2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: The programs are allocated with memory at run time.
6. [Static Allocation](https://iq.opengenus.org/static-memory-allocation-c/)
    Declaration of variables, structures, and classes at the beginning of a class or function. When you declare a variable or an instance of a structure or class. The memory for that object is allocated by the operating system. The name you declare for the object can then be used to access that block of memory.
7. [Dynamic Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/)
    When you use dynamic memory allocation you have the operating system designate a block of memory of the appropriate size while the program is running. This is done either with the new operator or with a call to the malloc function. The block of memory is allocated and a pointer to the block is returned. This is then stored in a pointer to the appropriate data type.
8. [Memory Management Unit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memory_management_unit)
    A memory management unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor. In other words, the MMU is responsible for all aspects of memory management. It is usually integrated into the processor, although in some systems it occupies a separate IC (integrated circuit) chip.
    The work of the MMU can be divided into three major categories:
    1. Hardware memory management, which oversees and regulates the processor's use of RAM (random access memory) and cache memory.
    2. OS (Operating System) memory management, which ensures the availability of adequate memory resources for the objects and data structures of each running program at all times.
    3. Application memory management, which allocates each individual program's required memory, and then recycles freed-up memory space when the operation concludes.
9.  [Paging](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Paging)
    Memory paging is a memory management technique for controlling how a computer or virtual machine's (VM's) memory resources are shared.
    A computer can address memory beyond the amount physically installed on the system. This nonphysical memory, which is called virtual memory, is actually a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. The concept of virtual memory comes from a time when physical memory, the amount of RAM installed on a computer, was extremely expensive. The portion of the hard disk that acts as physical memory is called a page file.  
    When a computer runs out of RAM, the operating system (OS) will move pages of memory over to the computer's hard disk to free up RAM for other processes. This ensures that the operating system will never run out of memory and crash. Too much reliance on memory paging can impair performance, however, because random access memory operates much faster than disk memory. This means the operating system has to wait for the disk to catch up every time a page is swapped; the more a workload relies on swap files, the more it will negatively impact performance.
10. [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)
    Computer memory uses both logical addresses and physical addresses. Address binding allocates a physical memory location to a logical pointer by associating a physical address to a logical address, which is also known as a virtual address. Address binding is part of computer memory management and it is performed by the operating system on behalf of the applications that need access to memory.
